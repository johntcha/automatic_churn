# automatic_churn_reporting
Python program that automates the reporting of churns by gathering data from helpscout, stripe and chartmogul APIs and writing them in a google sheet  

helpscout_credentials.json contains the credentials to access helpscout they are renewed each time the program runs  

I debbuged and improved this code through my internship at Weglot.  

All credits goes to Samuel HOLMES for the basic code development.
